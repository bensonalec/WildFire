# symmetrical-eureka
Project to prototype a simple interface for display, modification of, and adding of data in a database. 
Eventually, I want to actually open source this (at least some of this) as an open source tool for locally hosted database visualization). Basically, take what I've done here and make it plug and play with any sql database (not sure if this is possible in its current state)
