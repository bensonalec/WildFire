# WildFire
Dynamic, simple, and extensible tool for the visualization of databases for non-programmers. 

Built using Postrgre, Hasura, GraphQL, and Go

As I move towards being production ready, I will update usage and build instructions. 

Todo:
* Multiple Additions At Once
* Sorting
* Import and export CSV
* Edit tables
* Documentation
* Install scripts
* Make everything automated, from building db, pointing hasura at it, then launching the server itself
* Fix dropdown boxes in add menu
* Add foreign key table
* Populate foreign key table
* Implement foreign key relations in get page
* Refine tbl file parsing
